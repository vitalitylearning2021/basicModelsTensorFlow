# Basic machine learning models with TensorFlow

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is one of the fields of artificial intelligence and identifies the development of automatic learning systems capable to improve their own performance in a given task through experience. The applications of Machine Learning are the most varied and regard, to cite only a few examples, speech recognition, computer vision including autonomous driving cars, the classificiation of new astronomical structures exploited, for example, by NASA to automatically classify the celestial bodies in the sky surveys and the data-mining. 

### Classification of the Machine Learning algorithms

Machine Learning algorithms are typically divided in three main categories, depending on the type of learning used to contruct a forecast model.

  - *Supervised Learning*: the computer is trained by a learning set in which each input element is made up by a set of attributes to which an output value, called label, is attached. The output value represents the result associated to the corresponding input element. Once performed the training phase and built up the forecast model, the performance of the approach can be assessed by a testing phase in which the algorithm is applied to test data and the forecast results are compared to the "ground-truth" results.
  - *Unsupervised Learning*: in this case, no label is associated to the input data and the only way the algorithm has to construct a model is analyzing the input data and organize them on the basis of common features. Such an approach can be used either to highlight models hidden within the data or to return forecasts.
  - *Reinforced Learning*: by this approach, the program interacts with a dynamic environment from which it receives feedbacks according to the correctness of the performed action choices. The system receives a prize if the choice is right, while it receives a penalty if the choice is wrong.

A different division can be performed depending on the desired output. For the supervised learning, we have different approaches, among which:

  - *Classification*: in the case of classifiers, the inputs are subdivided into two or more classes and the algorithm must return a model capable to assign possible new elements to one of these classes.
  - *Regression*: in the case of regression, the outputs are numerical results, rather than classes.
